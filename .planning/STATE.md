# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-16)

**Core value:** Zero D1 reads on the public request path — architecturally zero, enforced structurally at build time.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Design Sketch & Editorial Identity

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 12 (Design Sketch & Editorial Identity)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-09-16 — Roadmap created; 137/137 v1 requirements mapped across 12 phases

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Content quality moved to Phase 2 — ahead of all bilingual generation, so no fabricated advisory is ever written in Spanish and then paid for twice.
- Roadmap: The CI D1-import assertion (ARCH-02/03) sits in Phase 3 Foundation as structural prevention, extended to island files in Phase 8.
- Roadmap: Loader fail-loud assertion (REND-02/03) ships in the same phase as the loader itself (Phase 4). This project already shipped the bug it prevents.
- Roadmap: Phase 5 is the premise gate — a non-zero D1 read on the public path halts the project for architecture review rather than being logged as a defect.
- Roadmap: The grounding check (CONT-04/05) ships with the prompt rewrite (CONT-03) because the costed dry run (CONT-09) depends on it.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **URGENT, Phase 3:** The OpenAI account sat at $0 returning HTTP 429 from 2026-09-04 to 2026-09-16. If `articles-semantic` is fed by OpenAI embeddings, ~1,200 articles may have no vector — silently degrading duplicate detection and semantic search. Verify before Phase 9 depends on it.
- Render-step location (cron worker / separate worker via Queues / CI) is unresolved pending the Phase 3 CPU-headroom and per-page-cost measurements. A full 82k rebuild at ~4 ms/page is ~330 s, over the 300 s Worker CPU ceiling regardless of location, so Queues fan-out may be required.
- Astro build time and memory at 41k-82k pages via a D1-backed loader has no public benchmark. Phase 4 is closer to novel territory than general Astro scaling suggests.
- One Phase 3 success criterion (the `articles-semantic` vector-gap check) has no dedicated REQ-ID; it is a measurement obligation feeding SRCH-02/SRCH-03 in Phase 9. Recorded deliberately rather than dropped.
